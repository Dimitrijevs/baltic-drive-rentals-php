                            We operate on a "full-to-full" fuel policy. When you pick up the car, it will have a full
                            tank, and we expect it to be returned with a full tank. If the car is returned with less
                            fuel, a refueling charge will be applied, along with the cost of the missing fuel. We
                            recommend keeping the fuel receipt as proof of refueling.

                            Our standard rental packages usually include unlimited mileage. However, it's important to
                            confirm this at the time of reservation. If there are mileage restrictions, additional
                            charges may apply for exceeding the allotted limit, and these rates will be outlined in your
                            rental agreement.
